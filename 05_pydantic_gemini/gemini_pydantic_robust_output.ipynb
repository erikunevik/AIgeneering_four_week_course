      "\n",
      "1.  **Paolo Rossi**\n",
      "    *   **Known for:** His incredible comeback story and Golden Boot/Golden Ball performance at the 1982 World Cup. A poacher with an uncanny ability to be in the right place.\n",
      "    *   **Important Clubs:** Vicenza, **Juventus**, AC Milan.\n",
      "\n",
      "2.  **Alessandro Altobelli**\n",
      "    *   **Known for:** \"Spillo\" (The Needle) was a prolific and consistent goalscorer, particularly for Inter, for over a decade. He was part of Italy's 1982 World Cup winning squad.\n",
      "    *   **Important Clubs:** Brescia, **Inter Milan**.\n",
      "\n",
      "3.  **Roberto Baggio**\n",
      "    *   **Known for:** Though often played as a *fantasista* (attacking midfielder), Baggio was consistently Italy's main goal threat for much of this era. His sublime skill, dribbling, and exquisite finishing made him a global superstar.\n",
      "    *   **Important Clubs:** **Fiorentina**, **Juventus**, **AC Milan**, Bologna, Inter Milan.\n",
      "\n",
      "4.  **Gianluca Vialli**\n",
      "    *   **Known for:** A powerful and complete forward, Vialli was a key figure in Sampdoria's golden era and later at Juventus, forming potent partnerships with other great forwards.\n",
      "    *   **Important Clubs:** Cremonese, **Sampdoria**, **Juventus**.\n",
      "\n",
      "5.  **Giuseppe Signori**\n",
      "    *   **Known for:** A remarkably prolific left-footed striker who was a serial Serie A top scorer. Known for his powerful and accurate shots, often from free-kicks, and his signature celebration (a one-armed wave).\n",
      "    *   **Important Clubs:** Foggia, **Lazio**, Sampdoria.\n",
      "\n",
      "6.  **Salvatore Schillaci**\n",
      "    *   **Known for:** His incredible, albeit brief, explosion onto the international stage at the 1990 World Cup, where he was the tournament's top scorer and best player. A tenacious and opportunistic striker.\n",
      "    *   **Important Clubs:** Messina, **Juventus**.\n",
      "\n",
